    LTC6804-1 Multicell Battery Monitor
@verbatim
    The LTC6804 is a 3rd generation multicell battery stack
    monitor that measures up to 12 series connected battery
    cells with a total measurement error of less than 1.2mV. The
    cell measurement range of 0V to 5V makes the LTC6804
    suitable for most battery chemistries. All 12 cell voltages
    can be captured in 290uS, and lower data acquisition rates
    can be selected for high noise reduction.

    Using the LTC6804-1, multiple devices are connected in
    a daisy-chain with one host processor connection for all
    devices.
